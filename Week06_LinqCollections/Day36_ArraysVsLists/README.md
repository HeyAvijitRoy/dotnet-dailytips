## LINQ on Arrays vs Lists

LINQ works seamlessly across different collection types in .NET, but how it behaves under the hood can influence performance.

Arrays are fixed-size and indexed â€” they provide faster enumeration.
Lists are more flexible but introduce some overhead, especially in large-scale LINQ operations or multiple enumerations.

This example measures the performance of a simple `.Where()` query on both arrays and lists to highlight potential performance differences, even if the result is logically identical.
