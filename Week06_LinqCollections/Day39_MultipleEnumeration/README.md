## Avoiding Multiple Enumeration in LINQ

One of the most common performance traps in LINQ is unintentionally enumerating the same query multiple times. LINQ queries are **deferred** by default â€” meaning every call to `.Count()`, `.First()`, `.ToList()` re-runs the entire query pipeline.

This is especially dangerous when your data source is remote (like a DB), expensive (like a stream), or mutating.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

* Why LINQ queries are deferred by design
* What happens when you enumerate a LINQ query multiple times
* How to safely cache results using `.ToList()` or `.ToArray()`
