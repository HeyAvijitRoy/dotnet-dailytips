## Week 6: LINQ + Collections

This week, we dive into how LINQ interacts with the most common .NET collection types — arrays, lists, dictionaries, hash sets, and more. While LINQ itself remains consistent, its behavior and performance can vary drastically depending on the underlying data structure. This week helps sharpen your understanding of when, why, and how to use LINQ effectively across collections.

From avoiding subtle bugs like multiple enumerations to picking the right data structure for `Distinct`, `Intersect`, or `GroupBy`, this week is packed with real-world takeaways.

### 🎯 Learning Goals

* Understand how LINQ behaves across collection types
* Spot performance traps using LINQ on lists or dictionaries
* Choose between `Lookup` and `Dictionary` appropriately
* Avoid subtle bugs from deferred execution and multiple enumeration
* Use set logic with LINQ: `Distinct`, `Union`, `Except`, `Intersect`

This week is where LINQ gets practical — bridging theory and real-world .NET usage.
