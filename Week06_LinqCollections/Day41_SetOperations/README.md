## Set-based operations in LINQ â€“ Except, Intersect, Union

LINQ provides built-in set operations that make list comparison and combination tasks easy and readable:

* `Except()` returns elements in the first sequence that are not in the second
* `Intersect()` returns elements common to both
* `Union()` returns all unique elements across both sequences

These methods rely on the default equality comparer unless you supply a custom one.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

* How to compare two collections using set logic
* Use cases for `Except`, `Intersect`, and `Union`
* Caveats around custom object comparisons and `IEquatable<T>`
