## Blog â€“ Real-world Tips for LINQ + Collections

This blog wraps up Week 6 with real-world insights into how LINQ behaves when paired with common .NET collections like arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Each daily post demonstrated practical usage, performance tradeoffs, and semantic differences that can catch developers off guard. This blog stitches those lessons into a unified playbook for writing safer, cleaner, and faster LINQ-based code in production.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

* Performance impact of using LINQ on arrays vs lists
* How `HashSet.Contains()` outperforms `Intersect()` in filtering
* Working with `Dictionary` and `KeyValuePair` in LINQ queries
* Dangers of multiple enumeration and how to avoid it
* Choosing `Lookup` over `Dictionary` for one-to-many mappings
* Effective use of LINQ set operators: `Except`, `Union`, `Intersect`

This week helps you graduate from "LINQ works" to "LINQ works well" â€” especially with large or performance-critical collections.
