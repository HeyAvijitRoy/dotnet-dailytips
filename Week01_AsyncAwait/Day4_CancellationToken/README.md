# Using CancellationToken effectively

A good async method isn’t just fast — it’s also **cancelable**.  
Ignoring `CancellationToken` can leave your app hanging, slow to shut down, or worse — wasting resources.

## 🧩 Why It Matters

- Gracefully stop background tasks
- Free up threads and memory early
- Handle user interrupts or timeouts
- Avoid abandoned or unmonitored operations
