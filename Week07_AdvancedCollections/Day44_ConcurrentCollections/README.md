## Using Concurrent Collections Safely

In multi-threaded applications, using standard collections like `List<T>` or `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` without synchronization leads to race conditions and data corruption.

.NET provides **Concurrent Collections** that are designed to be thread-safe without explicit locks:

* ConcurrentDictionary
* ConcurrentBag
* ConcurrentQueue
* ConcurrentStack

In this example, we use **ConcurrentDictionary** to count occurrences of words in parallel. The `AddOrUpdate` method ensures atomic updates, making it safe for multiple threads to modify the dictionary.

Additionally, you can apply LINQ queries on ConcurrentDictionary just like regular collections to project, filter, or aggregate data.

### Key Takeaways:

* Prefer ConcurrentDictionary when multiple threads read/write key-value data.
* `AddOrUpdate` provides atomic insert/update in one call.
* LINQ works seamlessly on Concurrent Collections for querying results after updates.
