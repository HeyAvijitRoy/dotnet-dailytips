## Week 7: Advanced Collections and LINQ Patterns

This week dives into **advanced collection types and LINQ patterns** that are crucial for writing high-performance and maintainable C# code. We’ll explore how specialized collections like dictionaries of lists, concurrent collections, immutable types, and priority queues can solve real-world problems with elegant LINQ queries. You’ll also learn how to avoid common pitfalls with readonly collections and build custom collection types that integrate seamlessly with LINQ.

By the end of this week, you’ll be able to:

* Manage complex data relationships using **Dictionary of Lists**.
* Handle multi-threaded data safely with **Concurrent Collections**.
* Leverage **Immutable Collections** for safer, bug-free code.
* Understand the subtle difference between **ReadOnlyCollection** and **IReadOnlyList**.
* Use **PriorityQueue** to implement efficient task schedulers.
* Extend LINQ with **Custom Collection Types**.
* Master advanced collection strategies through a real-world **blog deep dive**.
