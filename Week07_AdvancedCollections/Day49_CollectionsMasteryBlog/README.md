## Mastering Collections in C# — Week 7 Blog

Week 7 explored **Advanced Collections and LINQ Patterns** in .NET. Beyond the basic `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, we worked with specialized collections that improve safety, performance, and expressiveness.

### What We Covered

1. **Dictionary of Lists with LINQ** — Grouping related data under keys and querying with LINQ.
2. **Concurrent Collections** — Thread-safe updates with `ConcurrentDictionary`.
3. **Immutable Collections** — Predictable, unchangeable state with `ImmutableList<T>`.
4. **ReadOnlyCollection vs IReadOnlyList** — Understanding that both are *views*, not immutable containers.
5. **PriorityQueue** — Processing items by priority without manual sorting.
6. **Custom Collection Types and LINQ** — Designing collections that enforce rules but remain LINQ-friendly.

### Key Lessons

* **Thread-safety first**: Choose the right concurrent structure instead of locking later.
* **Immutability reduces bugs**: Use immutable collections when you need to guarantee no changes.
* **Read-only ≠ immutable**: Both `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `ReadOnlyCollection<T>` still reflect source changes.
* **Priorities matter**: `PriorityQueue` makes schedulers and algorithms cleaner.
* **Custom collections are worth it**: Implementing `IEnumerable<T>` gives full LINQ compatibility while enforcing rules.

By mastering these patterns, you can:

* Build APIs that are safer and more predictable.
* Avoid subtle bugs in multi-threaded or shared-state scenarios.
* Improve maintainability by picking the right tool for the job.
