## Day 61: System.IO.Pipelines — producers/consumers done right

`System.IO.Pipelines` is a high-performance API for working with producer/consumer scenarios without the overhead of manual buffer management.  
It is the backbone of networking stacks like ASP.NET Core’s Kestrel server.

### Key points:
- Designed for high-throughput streaming of data.  
- Producers write into the pipe, consumers read from it asynchronously.  
- Eliminates extra allocations and copies.  
- `Pipe.Reader` and `Pipe.Writer` manage synchronization and lifecycle.
