## Week 5: Mastering DateOnly, TimeOnly, and DateTime in .NET

Date and time handling is deceptively tricky in .NET — but it's also one of the most powerful and flexible parts of the framework. This week, we’ll tackle `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, `DateTime`, and `DateTimeOffset` in practical scenarios and show how to avoid common traps.

### Why this matters:

Improper handling of dates and time zones can cause data loss, logic errors, and hard-to-debug issues. By understanding the strengths and appropriate use of each type, you can:

* Avoid time zone bugs
* Write cleaner models for dates and times
* Ensure compatibility with APIs and serializers
* Improve clarity when working with LINQ and EF Core
