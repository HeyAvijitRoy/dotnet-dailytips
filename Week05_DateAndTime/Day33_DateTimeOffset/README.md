## DateTimeOffset vs DateTime in .NET

Choosing between `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` can drastically affect how your app handles time, especially across systems, APIs, and time zones.

### Why not always use DateTime?

* `DateTime.Now` gives local time **without** offset info
* `DateTime.UtcNow` gives UTC but lacks context of origin
* Serializing/deserializing can cause confusion without timezone data

### Why prefer DateTimeOffset?

* Combines date + time + UTC offset
* Makes your logs and API timestamps unambiguous
* Safer for scheduling and event-driven systems
* Easily convertible to `DateTime` if needed

### Best Practices:

* Use `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` for universal logging
* Use `DateTimeOffset.Now` for localized events with offset awareness
* Avoid `DateTime` unless interfacing with legacy systems
